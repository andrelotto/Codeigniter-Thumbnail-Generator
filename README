Codeigniter 2 Thumbnail Generator
=================================

Generates Image Thumbnails on the fly, in a similar way to TimThumb. The generated thumbnails are cached for later use.

Installation & Usage
--------------------

1. Download the image_helper.php file to your /application/helpers directory
2. In your /config/autoload.php file, add 'image_helper' to your helpers array
3. To output a thumbnail, include the function as the source of your image, eg:

	<img src="<?php echo thumb('/path/to/your/full/image.jpg','200','100'); ?>">

Where 200 is the thumbnail width and 100 is the height.
